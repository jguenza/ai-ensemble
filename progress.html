    <h3>Phase 1 — Controlled Interaction & Logging</h3>
    <p>
        The private Statistical Mechanics agent is operational. Each interaction begins 
        from a clean initial state. Conversations are logged securely in DigitalOcean.
    </p>
    <p>
        The goal in this phase is to generate high-quality conceptual dialogues 
        that reveal how structure re-emerges in each session.
    </p>

    <h3>Next Steps — Structure Extraction</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Analyze the logs using a second AI system</li>
        <li>Extract conceptual structures and recurring themes</li>
        <li>Generate chapter outlines for the emerging book</li>
        <li>Visualize the progress on this site</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Long-Term Vision</h3>
    <p>
        To grow a self-organizing, self-expanding book grounded entirely in human–AI 
        interaction, inspired by statistical mechanics and epistemic minimalism.
