    <h3>Where We Are</h3>

    <p>
        AI Ensemble is evolving into a system for AI-assisted experiment design. Early testers want
        an agent capable of producing statistically grounded designs (factorial, randomized, mixed
        models, augmented, longitudinal) while explaining the reasoning behind each choice.
    </p>

    <p>
        Some real research questions involve trade-offs and decisions that standard filtered models
        refuse to answer. AI Ensemble explores a low-filter regime so users can receive
        honest, structured, and complete experiment proposals.
    </p>

    <p>
        The system currently has two layers:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Front-end agent:</strong> interacts with users to produce experiment structures,
            confounder maps, hypotheses, sample-size strategies, and statistical models.</li>

        <li><strong>Ensemble agent:</strong> reads anonymized logs, detects recurring experiment
            structures, and evaluates credibility using probabilistic methods including Gibbs sampling.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        The next development phase includes automatic aggregation of experiment templates and
        probabilistic ranking of alternative designs.
