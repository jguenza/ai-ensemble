    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      Prompt. Observe. Diagnose. Improve. Repeat..
    </p>
    <p>
    By revealing conservative, balanced, and exploratory response patterns, 
    users learn to anticipate outcomes before they occur. This trains judgment, 
    not dependency. Children learn structured curiosity, students learn
    analytical framing, and professionals learn to design prompts that travel 
    reliably across systems and contexts.
    </p>
    <p>
      The middle plane presents three parallel responses—conservative, balanced, and exploratory—generated from the same prompt under different stochastic regimes. This exposes how the same question can legitimately lead to different answers. Users learn that variation is not noise or error, 
      but structure. Over time, they begin to predict which type of answer their prompt will produce, turning uncertainty into insight.
    </p>

    <h2>Good prompts are informed beliefs, not guesses.</h2>

        <h3>1. Refining — help you make a prompt</h3>
        <p>
        The first plane acts as a prompt coach. It helps users reformulate vague ideas
        into structured, meaningful problems using implicit Bayesian priors. 
        Instead of correcting answers, it teaches how questions are formed. 
        </p>
        <p>
         This makes it ideal for children learning critical thinking, students developing analytical skills, 
         and academics refining research questions. Learning happens at the level of reasoning, not imitation.      
        </p>
        <p>
          Teaching prompt literacy is teaching thinking.

        <h3>2. Ensemble — parallel stochastic alternatives</h3>
        <p>
          The middle plane presents three parallel responses—conservative, balanced, and exploratory—generated from 
          the same prompt under different stochastic regimes. This exposes how the same question can legitimately 
          lead to different answers. Users learn that variation is not noise or error, but structure. 
          Over time, they begin to predict which type of answer their prompt will produce, 
          turning uncertainty into insight.
        </p>
        <p>
         The system is grounded in Bayesian statistical principles. Implicit priors guide learning 
         and reasoning without storing, exposing, or modifying user input. 
         This mirrors how humans learn: updating beliefs based on evidence, not memorizing answers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outputs are rendered side-by-side to expose uncertainty 
          you get three answers, 1) conservative, 2) balanced 3) exploratory
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="stage">
        <h3>3. Output evaluator— find weak spots</h3>
        <p>
         The final plane critically evaluates the prompt itself, highlighting ambiguities, 
         hidden assumptions, and structural weaknesses. Because users already know the
        expected answer space, they can clearly see why a prompt failed or succeeded. 
        This closes the learning loop and initiates deliberate improvement—without trial-and-error guessing.
        </p>
        <p>
        Train once. Prompt anywhere.
        </p>
        <p>
        The end result is not a better answer in one system, but a reusable skill. 
        Users leave with prompts that are portable, robust, and intentional—because 
        they understand how and why those prompts work.

    <h2>Three planes 5 models</h2>
    <p>
      AI-Ensemble uses a multiple model generation paradigm rather than
      a conversational memory model.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each interface call is evaluated independently under explicit
      stochastic and prompt constraints. This allows ideas to mature 
      as it travels to our pipeline.
