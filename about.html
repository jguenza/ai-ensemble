            <h2>About the Author</h2>

            <p><strong>José Lúcio Lima Guerra</strong> is a statistician and quantitative geneticist working at the international vegetable breeding company <strong>Enza Zaden</strong>. His work focuses on statistical modelling, quantitative genetics, experimental design, and the development of AI-assisted tools for modern plant breeding pipelines.</p>

            <p>José is particularly interested in the relationships between:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>statistical mechanics and ensemble behaviour,</li>
                <li>uncertainty, inference, and emergent structure,</li>
                <li>and the capacity of memory-less AI systems to generate coherent narrative or conceptual order.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Project Motivation</h3>

            <p>The <strong>AI Ensemble</strong> project grew from a simple question:</p>

            <blockquote>
                Can structured knowledge emerge from an ensemble of conversations with an agent that has no memory at all?
            </blockquote>

            <p>This question echoes how statistical mechanics derives macroscopic order from microscopic randomness. Inspired by this analogy, José designed this project as an academic experiment investigating whether a coherent, evolving book could emerge from repeated clean-state AI interactions — each one starting from zero memory.</p>

            <p>All conceptual framing, vision, and methodological direction originate from <strong>José Lúcio Lima Guerra</strong>.</p>
