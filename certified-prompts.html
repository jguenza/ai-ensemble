    <h3>Certified Prompts</h3>

    <p>
        <strong>Certified Prompts</strong> are prompts that the AI Ensemble system has evaluated for:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>clarity of scientific intent</li>
        <li>statistical credibility</li>
        <li>absence of hidden confounders</li>
        <li>alignment with reproducible study design principles</li>
        <li>stability under probabilistic evaluation (e.g., Gibbs sampling)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Only prompts that consistently lead to stable and interpretable experimental designs are certified.
        As the project grows, more prompts will be added to this list.
    </p>

    <h3>Currently Certified Prompt</h3>

    <p>The following prompt has been fully certified:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>“What is an augmented design in plant breeding?”</strong><br>
            This prompt has passed checks for clarity, scientific relevance, and reproducibility.
            It consistently yields a stable and statistically correct description of the augmented design
            framework used in plant breeding trials.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Submit Your Prompt for Certification</h3>

    <p>
        You may submit your own prompt for certification.  
        The evaluation process examines whether your question:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>produces statistically sound designs when interpreted by the agent</li>
        <li>avoids ambiguity or hidden assumptions</li>
        <li>remains stable across multiple clean-state reasoning cycles</li>
        <li>matches recognized scientific frameworks (e.g., ANOVA, GLM, REML, experimental design theory)</li>
    </ul>
