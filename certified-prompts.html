    <h3>Certified Prompts</h3>

    <p>
        Certified Prompts are prompts that the AI Ensemble system has evaluated for:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>clarity of experimental intent</li>
        <li>statistical credibility</li>
        <li>absence of hidden confounders</li>
        <li>alignment with reproducible study design principles</li>
        <li>compatibility with proper model fitting and inference</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        These prompts have been tested using probabilistic scoring, including 
        <strong>Gibbs sampling credibility checks</strong>, ensuring that the experimental plan generated
        from each prompt remains stable under repeated clean-state reasoning.
    </p>

    <h4>Why Certification?</h4>

    <p>
        In real scientific work, small changes in phrasing can produce extremely different study
        designs. Certified Prompts help users ask questions in a way that leads the AI to produce
        robust, interpretable, and statistically consistent outputs.
    </p>

    <h4>Examples of Certified Prompts</h4>

    <p>These can be expanded as the system grows:</p>

    <ul>

        <li>
            <strong>Factorial Trials:</strong><br>
            “Design a 3×3 factorial experiment to test genotype × environment interaction,
            including randomization, replication strategy, and appropriate ANOVA model.”
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Genomic Prediction:</strong><br>
            “Propose a cross-validation scheme for genomic prediction with unbalanced trials,
            ensuring non-leakage between training and validation folds.”
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Agricultural Field Design:</strong><br>
            “Generate an augmented design with two checks repeated across blocks,
            including mixed model specification and expected precision.”
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Clinical Studies:</strong><br>
            “Construct a randomized controlled trial for comparing two interventions,
            including power analysis and identification of confounders.”
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Industrial Optimization:</strong><br>
            “Design a response-surface experiment to estimate quadratic effects
            with proper rotatability and minimal aliasing.”
        </li>

    </ul>
