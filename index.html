    <h3>The Project</h3>

    <p>
        <strong>AI Ensemble</strong> explores whether artificial intelligence can design credible,
        statistically defensible experiments directly from user interaction. Each session starts
        from a clean state — no memory, no customization, no long-term reinforcement — ensuring
        neutrality and scientific objectivity.
    </p>

    <p>
        The agent assists researchers in designing experiments across plant breeding, agronomy,
        biology, clinical trials, industrial optimization, and social sciences. It helps generate
        hypotheses, select factors, outline statistical structures, detect confounders, and produce
        reproducible designs.
    </p>

    <p>
        A second agent processes anonymous logs using ensemble statistics and Gibbs sampling to
        understand which experiment patterns consistently emerge as credible solutions.

    <h3>How the System Learns</h3>

    <p>
        All interactions with the agent are logged anonymously. A second agent evaluates recurring
        structures, tests credibility of proposed designs, and synthesizes ensemble knowledge about
        what constitutes a strong experimental plan.
