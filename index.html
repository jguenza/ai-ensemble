    <h3>The Project</h3>

    <p>
        <strong>AI Ensemble</strong> Our approach focuses on validating classical scientific research through reproducible code and making that validated code accessible via                           Generative AI and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).
The process involves:

Reviewing and verifying scientific articles by reproducing their results through rigorous statistical programming.
Registering validated code in a curated RAG knowledge base, ensuring transparency and reproducibility.
Blending expert-reviewed code with domain insights and AI capabilities to deliver precise guidance for coding strategies and genetic analysis.

This enables researchers and data scientists to design experiments, generate hypotheses, and apply probability-driven thinking using validated resources.
<strong>We are  delivering an Experimental Desing Agent</strong>
It will leverage on validaded simulation code and also help you get the most value out of your data based on verified statistical code 

    </p>

    <p>
        The agent assists user to generate hypotheses 
        and enable probability thinking using cureted code.
    </p>

    <p>
        Validated code, gathered from experts and used to replicate scientific articles, is registered in our RAG database.
       This code, combined with insights from subject matter experts, 
       is integrated with AI to deliver precise guidance for coding practices and genetic strategy.
