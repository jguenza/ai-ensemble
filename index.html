    <h3>The Project</h3>

    <p>
        <strong>AI Ensemble</strong> is a framework that validates classical scientific research through reproducible code and delivers that verified knowledge through Generative AI and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).
Our objective is to create a trustworthy, expert-aligned computational layer that scientists can rely on for experiment design, hypothesis generation, and probability-based reasoning.

         <strong>Our Approach</strong> 
Reproduce and validate scientific articles
We critically review scientific publications and reproduce their results using rigorous statistical and computational methods. The goal is to confirm the correctness and reproducibility of the findings.

Register validated code in a curated RAG knowledge base
Verified code—together with expert annotations, assumptions, and constraints—is stored in a structured knowledge base. This ensures transparency, traceability, and long-term reproducibility.

Integrate validated resources with Generative AI
Curated code and domain insights are combined with modern AI capabilities to provide:

Precise coding guidance

Reliable statistical advice

Genetic analysis strategies grounded in validated methods

Enable probability-driven, hypothesis-oriented research
By anchoring AI responses in peer-reviewed computational evidence, researchers can:

Design robust experiments

Explore hypotheses using simulation

Apply probabilistic thinking with confidence

<strong>Experimental Design Agent</strong>
The first product of the AI Ensemble project is the Experimental Design Agent.

This agent:

Leverages validated simulation code as its computational backbone.

Helps users obtain maximum value from their data by referencing verified statistical workflows.

Supports hypothesis generation, experimental planning, and uncertainty quantification using expert-curated resources.

Ensures recommendations remain aligned with established scientific principles and formally validated implementations.

<strong>Role of Validated Code</strong>

Validated code is central to AI Ensemble:

It is reproduced, reviewed, and approved by subject-matter experts.

It forms the technical foundation of our RAG database.

It constrains and informs AI outputs, preventing hallucinations and ensuring reproducible recommendations.

It connects AI reasoning directly to authoritative computational sources used to replicate scientific work.

As a result, the platform delivers AI-augmented scientific support that is transparent, defensible, and grounded in real computational evidence.

<strong>Value Proposition</strong>
AI Ensemble produces large volumes of reliable statistical and genetic-analysis code—generated by AI but supervised, corrected, and validated by experts.
This code becomes reusable infrastructure that accelerates a wide range of scientific activities:

Experimental design

Statistical modeling

Genomic prediction and simulation

Hypothesis testing

Probability-driven decision-making

Researchers benefit from expert-verified, AI-supported workflows that drastically reduce the time needed to design and evaluate scientific experiments.

It will leverage on validaded simulation code and also help you get the most value out of your data based on verified statistical code

        The agent assists user to generate hypotheses 
        and enable probability thinking using cureted code.
    </p>

    <p>
        Validated code, gathered from experts and used to replicate scientific articles, is registered in our RAG database.
       This code, combined with insights from subject matter experts, 
       is integrated with AI to deliver precise guidance for coding practices and genetic strategy.
