    <h1>AI-Ensemble</h1>

    <p>
      <strong>AI-Ensemble is a role-playing learning game for expert reasoning.</strong>
      It is available as an online service and as a fully local system built on the same core logic.
    </p>

    <p>
      Users do not interact with AI-Ensemble as a generic chatbot.
      Instead, they enter a <strong>designed role-playing environment</strong> in which learning
      happens through reasoning, decision-making, and confrontation with curated knowledge.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h2>The role-playing learning game</h2>

    <p>
      At the core of AI-Ensemble is a role-playing learning game.
      Users take on professional roles such as:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>coder</li>
      <li>statistician</li>
      <li>breeder</li>
      <li>director or decision-maker</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Each role frames how problems are presented and which trade-offs matter.
      The same underlying knowledge may lead to different conclusions depending
      on the role being played.
    </p>

    <p>
      Learning is driven by <strong>engineered progression</strong>:
      knowledge is introduced deliberately, users must justify claims using
      available material, and progress can be blocked when understanding
      is insufficient.
    </p>

    <p>
      Speed and fluency do not matter.
      What matters is reasoning, consistency, and evidence.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h2>One system, two ways to run it</h2>

    <p>
      AI-Ensemble is offered in two distributions of the same system:
      an online version and a local version.
      Both share the same learning logic, grounding rules, and role-playing mechanics.
    </p>

    <h3>Online version</h3>

    <p>
      The online version provides the full role-playing learning game
      as a hosted service.
      It is intended for users who want immediate access and a managed environment
      without local setup.
    </p>

    <h3>Local version (CPU-only, low-carbon)</h3>

    <p>
      The local version is a direct spin-off of the online system.
      It runs entirely on the user’s own machine using
      <strong>quantized, CPU-only models</strong>.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>No GPU required</li>
      <li>No dependence on large cloud providers</li>
      <li>User-configurable knowledge and settings</li>
      <li>Offline-capable</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The user can purchase either the online or the local version,
      depending on their needs.
      The learning game remains the same; only the deployment differs.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h2>Reliability through controlled inputs</h2>

    <p>
      Across both online and local versions, AI-Ensemble follows a strict rule:
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>The system reasons only over explicitly provided and curated knowledge.</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
      If information is not present, the system does not invent it.
      “I don’t know” is a valid and intentional outcome.
      Reliability comes from input control and explicit evidence,
      not from model scale.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h2>Responsible AI by design</h2>

    <p>
      By offering a local, CPU-only version built on quantized models,
      AI-Ensemble reduces environmental impact and avoids dependence
      on GPU-heavy infrastructure and mega cloud providers.
    </p>

    <p>
      This design supports privacy, sustainability, and long-term
      educational and professional use.
    </p>

      </a>
    </div>

    <hr>

    <p class="muted">
      AI-Ensemble is a learning and decision-support system.
      It does not replace expert judgment and should not be used
      outside the scope of its explicitly provided knowledge.
