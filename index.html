    <h3>The Project</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>AI Ensemble</strong> is an academic experiment exploring whether a coherent,
        structured book can emerge from repeated interactions with an AI agent that starts
        from a clean initial state in every session — without memory, without context
        accumulation, and without long-term reinforcement.
    </p>

    <p>
        The hypothesis is that <em>structure emerges from ensemble behaviour</em>, similar
        to how statistical mechanics derives macroscopic order from microstate distributions.

    <h3>How the Book Will Emerge</h3>
    <p>
        All interactions with the agent are logged. A second system will later read these
        logs, extract conceptual structures, and assemble them into an evolving book.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
        Can knowledge emerge from an ensemble of conversations with a memoryless agent?
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        The long-term vision is a self-building academic manuscript grounded entirely
        in human–AI dialogue.
