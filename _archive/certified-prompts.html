    <h3>Certified Prompts</h3>

    <p>
        <strong>Certified Prompts</strong> are prompts that AI Ensemble has evaluated and confirmed to produce
        stable, scientifically credible, and reproducible experimental designs. They pass tests for:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>clarity of scientific intent</li>
        <li>absence of hidden confounders</li>
        <li>statistical and experimental design correctness</li>
        <li>stability under probabilistic evaluation (e.g., Gibbs sampling)</li>
        <li>alignment with accepted statistical models (mixed models, ANOVA, GLM, etc.)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Only prompts that consistently produce valid designs across many clean-state runs are certified.

    <h3>Current Certified Prompt (Example)</h3>

    <p>
        This certified prompt is provided as an example of the type of scientific prompt that meets 
        the certification criteria.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Topic (Example):</strong> Augmented Design in Plant Breeding
    </p>

    <p>
        The exact wording of the certified prompt is <strong>not publicly displayed</strong> to protect its 
        intellectual and scientific value. The certified version reliably produces:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>a correct description of augmented block designs</li>
        <li>proper check and treatment structure</li>
        <li>valid mixed-model variance components</li>
        <li>expected precision and variance interpretation</li>
        <li>a layout consistent with real breeding practice</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Additional certified prompts exist and are accessible through a 
        <strong>password-protected Certified Prompt Page</strong>.

    <h3>Submit Your Prompt for Certification</h3>

    <p>
        You may submit your own experimental-design prompt for certification. Submitted prompts are evaluated
        to determine whether they produce:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>stable and credible designs under fresh-state reasoning</li>
        <li>proper model structure and statistical interpretation</li>
        <li>clear identification of confounders and factor structure</li>
        <li>consistent output under Gibbs-sampling stress testing</li>
    </ul>
