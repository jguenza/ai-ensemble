    <h1>Example scenarios</h1>

    <p>
      This page presents concrete examples of how AI-Ensemble is used
      as a role-playing learning game across different professional contexts.
    </p>

    <details>
      <summary>Application platform lead — managing a local-to-cloud journey</summary>

      <p>
        The user runs AI-Ensemble locally to reason over internal architecture notes,
        platform constraints, and design decisions using only trusted, user-provided inputs.
      </p>

      <p>
        This local setup allows private exploration of assumptions and trade-offs
        before exposing any material to cloud infrastructure.
      </p>

      <p>
        Once the reasoning is clear, the online role-playing learning game is used
        to explore the journey to the cloud from different roles and perspectives,
        such as developer, architect, and decision-maker.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Breeding manager — implementing genomic selection</summary>

      <p>
        The user engages with AI-Ensemble to reason through the introduction
        of genomic selection by confronting curated material on breeding goals,
        data availability, model assumptions, and organizational constraints.
      </p>

      <p>
        By switching roles (e.g. breeder, statistician, director),
        the learning game exposes how different expert perspectives
        influence risk, feasibility, and timelines.
      </p>

      <p>
        This structured role-playing helps clarify decision points
        before committing to changes in breeding strategy or infrastructure.
      </p>

      Additional examples will be added over time.
